# 42 Monkey Tester Suite

This repository is a collection of setup script for my `monkey-tester` suite.
These testers mainly use [fuzzing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing).
The name comes from [ft_containers_monkey_tester](https://github.com/jgiron42/ft_containers_monkey_tester), and if you ever used it on your `ft_container`, well, maybe you know it's not the easiest tester to pass.
